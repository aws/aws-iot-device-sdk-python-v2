# AWS IoT SDK for Python v2

Next generation AWS IoT Client SDK for Python.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([1](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[2](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[3](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt), ...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to Python by the [awscrt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python) package.

Integration with AWS IoT Services such as
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
and [Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
is provided by code that been generated from a model of the service.

# Installation
## Minimum Requirements
*   Python 3.5+ or Python 2.7+
*   CMake 3.1+
*   Clang 3.9+ or GCC 4.4+ or MSVC 2015+

## Build from source
```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python.git --recursive
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2.git
pip install ./aws-crt-python
pip install ./aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2
```

# Samples

## pubsub
This sample uses the Message Broker for AWS IoT to send and receive messages
through an MQTT connection. On startup, the device connects to the server,
subscribes to a topic, and begins publishing messages to that topic.
The device should receive those same messages back from the message broker,
since it is subscribed to that same topic.
Status updates are continually printed to the console.

Source: `samples/pubsub.py`

Run the sample like this:
```
python pubsub.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file>
```

Your Thing's
[Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html)
must provide privileges for this sample to connect, subscribe, publish,
and receive. The Policy document should look something like this:

<pre>
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topic/samples/test"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:topicfilter/samples/test"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:client/samples-client-id"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

## shadow

This sample uses the AWS IoT Device Shadow Service to keep a property in
sync between device and server. Imagine a light whose color may be changed
through an app, or set by a local user.

Once connected, type a value in the terminal and press Enter to update
the property's "reported" value. The sample also responds when the "desired"
value changes on the server. To observe this, edit the Shadow document in
the AWS Console and set a new "desired" value.

On startup, the sample requests the shadow document to learn the property's
initial state. The sample also subscribes to "delta" events from the server,
which are sent when a property's "desired" value differs from its "reported"
value. When the sample learns of a new desired value, that value is changed
on the device and an update is sent to the server with the new "reported"
value.

Source: `samples/shadow.py`

Run the sample like this:
```
python shadow.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file> --thing-name <name>
```
