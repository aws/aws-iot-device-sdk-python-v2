# AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python
This document provides information about the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python.

If you have any issues or feature requests, please file an issue or pull request.

API documentation: https://aws.github.io/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2/

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-compression](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-compression),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal),
[aws-c-auth](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth),
[s2n](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n) ...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to Python by the `awscrt` package ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awscrt/)) ([Github](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python)).

## Installation

### Minimum Requirements
*   Python 3.5+

### Install from PyPI
```
python3 -m pip install awsiotsdk
```

### Install from source
```
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2.git
python3 -m pip install ./aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2
```

### Installation Issues

`awsiotsdk` depends on [awscrt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python), which makes use of C extensions. Precompiled wheels are downloaded when installing on major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, Raspbian. If wheels are unavailable for your platform, your machine must compile some C libraries. If you encounter issues, install the following and try again:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

## Mac-Only TLS Behavior

Please note that on Mac, once a private key is used with a certificate, that certificate-key pair is imported into the Mac Keychain.  All subsequent uses of that certificate will use the stored private key and ignore anything passed in programmatically.  Beginning in v1.3.2, when a stored private key from the Keychain is used, the following will be logged at the "info" log level:

```
static: certificate has an existing certificate-key pair that was previously imported into the Keychain.  Using key from Keychain instead of the one provided.
```
