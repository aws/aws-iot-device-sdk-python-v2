        Performs a 'Subscribe' style operation for an MQTT service.
        Messages received from this topic are processed as JSON,
        converted to the desired class by `payload_to_class_fn`,

        Parameters:

        qos   - The Quality of Service guarantee of this message
        callback - The callback to invoke when a message is received.
                The callback should take one argument of the type

                is not expected to return a value.

                a dict, and returns a class of the type expected by
                `callback`. The dict comes from parsing the received
                message as JSON.

        Returns two values. The first is a `Future` whose result will be the
        `awscrt.mqtt.QoS` granted by the server, or an exception if the
        subscription fails. The second value is a topic which may be passed to
