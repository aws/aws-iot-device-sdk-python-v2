# - Overview -
# This sample uses the AWS IoT Jobs Service to get a list of pending jobs and
# then execution operations on these pending jobs until there are no more
# remaining on the device. Imagine periodic software updates that must be sent to and
# executed on devices in the wild.
#
# - Instructions -
# This sample requires you to create jobs for your device to execute. See:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-manage-jobs.html
#
# - Detail -
# On startup, the sample tries to get a list of all the in-progress and queued
# jobs and display them in a list. Then it tries to start the next pending job execution.
# If such a job exists, the sample emulates "doing work" by spawning a thread
# that sleeps for several seconds before marking the job as SUCCEEDED. When no
# pending job executions exist, the sample sits in an idle state.
#
# The sample also subscribes to receive "Next Job Execution Changed" events.
# If the sample is idle, this event wakes it to start the job. If the sample is
# already working on a job, it remembers to try for another when it's done.
# This event is sent by the service when the current job completes, so the
# sample will be continually prompted to try another job until none remain.

# Using globals to simplify sample code
is_sample_done = threading.Event()

# cmdData is the arguments/input from the command line placed into a single struct for
# use in this sample. This handles all of the command line parsing, validating, etc.
# See the Utils/CommandLineUtils for more information.
