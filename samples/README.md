### Build instructions

First, install the `aws-iot-devices-sdk-python-v2` with following the instructions from [Installation](../README.md#Installation).

Each sample README has instructions on how to run each sample with the same name as the sample itself. For example, the [PubSub README](./pubsub.md) is `pubsub.md` and it can be run with the following:

``` sh
# For Windows: replace 'python3' with 'python' and '/' with '\'
python3 pubsub.py --endpoint <endpoint> --cert <path to certificate> --key <path to private key>
```

### Sample Help

All samples will show their options by passing in `--help`. For example:

``` sh
# For Windows: replace 'python3' with 'python' and '/' with '\'
python3 pubsub.py --help
```

Which will result in output showing all of the options that can be passed in at the command line, along with descriptions of what each does and whether they are optional or not.

### Enable logging in samples

To enable logging in the samples, you need to pass the `--verbosity` as an additional argument. `--verbosity` controls the level of logging shown. `--verbosity` can be set to `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Fatal`, or `None`.

For example, to run [PubSub](./pubsub/README.md) sample with logging you could use the following:

``` sh
# For Windows: replace 'python3' with 'python' and '/' with '\'
python3 pubsub.py <other arguments> --verbosity Debug
```
