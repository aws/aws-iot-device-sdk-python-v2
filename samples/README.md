# Samples

## pubsub
This sample uses the
[Message Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html)
for AWS IoT to send and receive messages
through an MQTT connection. On startup, the device connects to the server,
subscribes to a topic, and begins publishing messages to that topic.
The device should receive those same messages back from the message broker,
since it is subscribed to that same topic.
Status updates are continually printed to the console.

Source: `samples/pubsub.py`

Run the sample like this:
```
python pubsub.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file>
```

## shadow

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
Service to keep a property in
sync between device and server. Imagine a light whose color may be changed
through an app, or set by a local user.

Once connected, type a value in the terminal and press Enter to update
the property's "reported" value. The sample also responds when the "desired"
value changes on the server. To observe this, edit the Shadow document in
the AWS Console and set a new "desired" value.

On startup, the sample requests the shadow document to learn the property's
initial state. The sample also subscribes to "delta" events from the server,
which are sent when a property's "desired" value differs from its "reported"
value. When the sample learns of a new desired value, that value is changed
on the device and an update is sent to the server with the new "reported"
value.

Source: `samples/shadow.py`

Run the sample like this:
```
python shadow.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file> --thing-name <name>
```

## jobs

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
Service to receive and execute operations
on the device. Imagine periodic software updates that must be sent to and
executed on devices in the wild.

This sample requires you to create jobs for your device to execute. See
[instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-manage-jobs.html).

On startup, the sample tries to start the next pending job execution.
If such a job exists, the sample emulates "doing work" by spawning a thread
that sleeps for several seconds before marking the job as SUCCEEDED. When no
pending job executions exist, the sample sits in an idle state.

The sample also subscribes to receive "Next Job Execution Changed" events.
If the sample is idle, this event wakes it to start the job. If the sample is
already working on a job, it remembers to try for another when it's done.
This event is sent by the service when the current job completes, so the
sample will be continually prompted to try another job until none remain.

Source: `samples/jobs.py`

Run the sample like this:
```
python jobs.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file> --thing-name <name>
```

## fleet provisioning

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Fleet provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html)
to provision devices using either a CSR or KeysAndcertificate and subsequently calls RegisterThing.

On startup, the script subscribes to topics based on the request type of either CSR or Keys topics,
publishes the request to corresponding topic and calls RegisterThing.

Source: `samples/fleetprovisioning.py`

Run the sample using createKeysAndCertificate:
```
python fleetprovisioning.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file> --templateName <name> --templateParameters <parameters>
```

Run the sample using createCertificateFromCsr:
```
python fleetprovisioning.py --endpoint <endpoint> --root-ca <file> --cert <file> --key <file> --templateName <name> --templateParameters <parameters> --csr <csr file>
```
