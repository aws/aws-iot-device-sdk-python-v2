# Websocket Connect

[**Return to main sample list**](./README.md)

This sample makes an MQTT connection via Websockets and then disconnects. On startup, the device connects to the server via Websockets and then disconnects right after. This sample is for reference on connecting via Websockets. This sample demonstrates the most straightforward way to connect via Websockets by querying the AWS credentials for the connection from the device's environment variables or local files.

Your IoT Core Thing's [Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policies.html) must provide privileges for this sample to connect. Below is a sample policy that can be used on your IoT Core Thing that will allow this sample to run as intended.

<details>
<summary>(see sample policy)</summary>
<pre>
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Connect"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iot:<b>region</b>:<b>account</b>:client/test-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

Replace with the following with the data from your AWS account:
* `<region>`: The AWS IoT Core region where you created your AWS IoT Core thing you wish to use with this sample. For example `us-east-1`.
* `<account>`: Your AWS IoT Core account ID. This is the set of numbers in the top right next to your AWS account name when using the AWS IoT Core website.

Note that in a real application, you may want to avoid the use of wildcards in your ClientID or use them selectively. Please follow best practices when working with AWS on production applications using the SDK. Also, for the purposes of this sample, please make sure your policy allows a client ID of `test-*` to connect or use `--client_id <client ID here>` to send the client ID your policy supports.

For this sample, using Websockets will attempt to fetch the AWS credentials to authorize the connection from your environment variables or local files. See the [authorizing direct AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html) page for documentation on how to get the AWS credentials, which then you can set to the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables.

## How to run

To run the websocket connect from the `samples` folder, use the following command:

``` sh
# For Windows: replace 'python3' with 'python' and '/' with '\'
python3 websocket_connect.py --endpoint <endpoint> --signing_region <signing region>
```
