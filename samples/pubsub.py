# This sample uses the Message Broker for AWS IoT to send and receive messages
# through an MQTT connection. On startup, the device connects to the server,
# subscribes to a topic, and begins publishing messages to that topic.
# The device should receive those same messages back from the message broker,
# since it is subscribed to that same topic.

# cmdData is the arguments/input from the command line placed into a single struct for
# use in this sample. This handles all of the command line parsing, validating, etc.
# See the Utils/CommandLineUtils for more information.
